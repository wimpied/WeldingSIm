Due to compatibility issues, Unity doesn't allow standard assets to be added in the package. To get the same look as in screenshots, 
please download the "Post-processing stack" and "Garage PP parameters" files from here:

https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5BfQWPy10ctcV9WYjFSR3pKRm8/view

Once you have imported the files, Drag "Post Processing behaviour" script to your Camera and assign "Garage.asset" into it. Now, you should have the look.  
 
If you have any trouble setuping the scene, contact me at mudhham@gmail.com

Thank you,

Bhasker Dee.
